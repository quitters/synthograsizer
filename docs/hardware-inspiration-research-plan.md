### 7. Organization Strategy
- Group findings by primary function (sequencer, synthesizer, drum machine, etc.)
- Categorize by interface type (grid, knobs, touchscreen, etc.)
- Sort by synthesis method (subtractive, FM, wavetable, etc.)
- Arrange by design philosophy (minimalist, comprehensive, modular)
- Create cross-reference index for features that span multiple categories

### 8. Component Routing Paradigms

- Explore semi-modular implementations that balance flexibility with usability

## Deliverables
1. Comprehensive reference document with categorized hardware inspirations
2. Feature matrix comparing key aspects across different hardware platforms
3. Design principles extraction document highlighting successful UX patterns
4. Proposed implementation roadmap for Synthograsizer based on findings

## Next Steps
- Begin with research on grid-based controllers most similar to current Synthograsizer interface
- Prioritize research on hardware with innovative approaches to scale/note organization
- Document findings in a standardized format for easy reference and implementation
